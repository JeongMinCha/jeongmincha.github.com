### The Research Field That I Am Interested in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested to research EDM (Educational Data Mining) and ITS (Intelligent Tutoring System). As I participated in performing an Academic-industrial reasearch project in the data mining labortary of Hanyang University and wrote a graduation thesis, I became interested in data mining and machine learning. I also worked as a programming instructor in a private educational institute. The experience as an instructor teaching software made me get concered about educational data and data mining technologies related to using educational data. It was to encounter codility--A platform in where people solve algorithm problems--that I decided to research ITS, a specific topic in educational data mining.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In codility, an user could see their codes at every moment and I thought the codes could be used as time-series data and apply them into machine learning algorithm. I also thought that this might discover how learners' thought would develop and what learning patterns they have. Thus, I decided to research ITS which can help learners learn programming by using data mining and machine learning algorithms in the graduate school in where I am.
