### Notice
  Unfortunately, I will use only Korean in all the lectures.


### Leture Links
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_sanVl1UIb3ZDNpSiHidJmUK6ipQPEia" target="_blank">Youtube Playlist</a>
- <a href="http://www.inflearn.com" target="_blank">Inflearn</a>
    - The lecture in Inflearn is in the mill yet.


### Prerequisite
- Base expericenes on web technologies.
    - If you used HTML/CSS/Javascript, it would be the best.
    - But if you're an advanced developer, this lecture would be too easy for you.


### My lecture videos in Yotube, Inflearn
I am making lecture videos about mobile application development by using Ionic 2 framework in <a href="http://www.inflearn.com" target="_blank">Inflearn</a>. This lecture has four sections.  

- First section (section 0) has only an orientation video.   
- Second section (section 1) is giving some basic knowledge such as how to prepare to develop something by Ionic 2, what ionic 2, angular js 2 and typescript is.  
- Third section (section 2) is giving fundamental theory of programming language by using Typescript because Typescript is recommended by Ionic 2 communities.  
- Last section (section 3) is the core part of this lecture. This section will handle UI components in Ionic 2 framework.
