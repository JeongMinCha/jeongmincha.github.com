# What I've made
&nbsp;&nbsp;This application is an bank application, which makes students who need money apply loans and ones who can afford money give their money to others. The application cannot support transactions for real money, but can provide users with virtual money called 'blue key'. KidariBank has blue color as its representative color, so it would say the virtual money is called as blue key. One blue key is exactly same as 10,000 won. If you want to borrow 300,000 won, you can apply loan with 30 blue keys.
