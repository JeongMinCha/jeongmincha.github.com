title: Review - First full-stack outsourcing project
---

### What I've made
&nbsp;&nbsp;This application is an bank application, which makes students who need money apply loans and ones who can afford money give their money to others. The application cannot support transactions for real money, but can provide users with virtual money called 'blue key'. KidariBank has blue color as its representative color, so it would say the virtual money is called as blue key. One blue key is exactly same as 10,000 won. If you want to borrow 300,000 won, you can apply loan with 30 blue keys.  

### My feeling after I've made this application
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made an full-stack platform (server + client) for the first time. For the past, I made only client product or one which only needs client platform such as utility application. The expericence for developing this experience seems make me more a reliable software engineer. This outsourcing experience gave me some money which is a lot for a student. Now I would say I can make Flask API servers, hybrid applications powered by Ionic2 framework. I think it was valuable experience.
