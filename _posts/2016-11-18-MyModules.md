title: My Reusable Modules 
---

### Why do I write my modules in here?
&nbsp;&nbsp; I always want to be a computer engineer who arranges his works and re-use them. I think the desirable people are valuable and they could be recognized as the most important and irreplaceable people in some organizations. This thought of mine made me write this post. I will write my modular codes in this post, re-use and arrange them.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope this post will make me more valuable person and this post would be used as my useful portfolio.
